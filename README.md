## This is a website designed for Buyer Apps in ONDC to Score the Seller Catalogs.
## For this Project We took "Meesho" as our client. We Scored Products from the perspective of Meesho Buyer App. 
    ## our website has three pages.
        ## First page shows the complete product details and Scores assigned including Completenss, Correctness, Compliance.
        ## Secong Page is used to scrape the Seller Catalog, Since Seller is only found upon searching in ONDC, 
            We thought, as of now scraping is best way to collect seller data for scoring
        ## Third Page shows the collection of catalogs. This page shows complete information of all products in catalog.
